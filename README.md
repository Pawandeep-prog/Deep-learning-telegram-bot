<h1>Description</h1>
In this video we will learn to create a telegram bot which takes the image from user and  predicts the class of that image. This bot uses ResNet50 model for the prediction. We will create the telegram bot using python and the module which is called python-telegram-bot.<br>
As discussed this bot works with images and keras model/ tensorflow model takes that image as input and then bot replies which with class.<br>
So in this video we will learn how to,<br>
Command Handle <br>
Message Handle<br>
Image Handle<br>
all of this step by step which line by line.<br>
